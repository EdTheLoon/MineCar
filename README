This plugin will allow players to ride in a minecart that they can control using WASD as a control scheme.

Below is how I think this will work

Players can only have one MineCar at a time. This will be tracked in a HashMap with the Player name as a key and the EntityID
as the value. This will be stored in a flatfile on the server as well so data is kept between restarts/reloads.

A MineCar is created by either:
 - Pressing a key on their keyboard and then punching the ground where they want to spawn a MineCar
 - Typing a command and then punching the ground where a MineCar should be spawned
 - Creating a normal Minecart, getting in then pressing a Key or typing a command to make it a MineCar
 - Climbing into any Minecart will make it a MineCar (not recommended)
The first option is the one I think we should aim for

Here is the entire process:

- Server start
- Plugin start
- Load flatfile if it exists
- Register listener for keypress events
- Regiser listener for EntityDamage (or destroy?) event
- Register listener for BlockDamage events
- Register listener for VehicleEnter and VehicleExit events
- Player presses key (M?)
- Player hit's ground
- First check if the player already has a MineCar, if they do then follow the indented code, else skip indented code
	- Either delete the MineCar they already have or set it's location to the punched block
- Spawn a MineCar at punched location (FYI spawn location will have to be 1 higher than punched block)
- Player get's in MineCar
- Player presses either W, A, S or D
- If key was W or S then move cart forward or backward. Suggested method for this is MineCar.setVelocityX(...) (need to refer to API for this part)
- If key was A or D then rotate MineCar left or right. I think this would be done using setYaw?
- Player gets out of MineCar
- If player decides to destroy it then make sure to remove it from the HashMap
